### AI Usage by Students ðŸ§ 
A beginner machine learning project exploring how students use AI tools.

### ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This is a beginner-level data science project I created while learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, encoding, and classification modeling using Python.

The goal of the project is to explore a dataset about how students use AI and to build a simple classification model that predicts or analyzes patterns in AI usage.

Itâ€™s a practice project meant to strengthen my understanding of the end-to-end machine learning workflow â€” from data cleaning to model evaluation.

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aimed to understand the machine learning workflow, to learn feature engineering and encoding techniques and to Practice using scikit-learn for classification models.

### ðŸ§  What I Did

Loaded the dataset, Cleaned the data, Engineered new features from existing columns, Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding), Built and evaluated a simple classification model and Interpreted results and learned from model outputs
